# beacon-ball
Throwing some info around the office, a project lounge idea.
The idea is that we want human interaction to remain at the forefront of our minds. Sitting behind a computer all day means it can often be limited.

What do we do all day? We share information! Rather than just sending a link via a chat, why not create something that implements a bit of fun alongside the human interaction? This is where the beacon ball comes in!


# Installation
```
npm install
```
You can run this locally but the beacon needs a fixed url, [so it is hosted here](http://hxpaul.github.io/beacon-ball/). Push changes to the gh-pages branch to deploy.


# Requirements
Something to read from a beacon, I'm using https://github.com/dermike/physical-web-scan on the laptop.
