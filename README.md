# beacon-ball
Throwing some info around the office, a project lounge.

# Installation
```
npm install
```
You can run this locally but the beacon needs a fixed url at the moment, so this needs to be run from one agreed public url. So we'll publish this to aws.


# Requirements
Something to read from a beacon, I'm using https://github.com/dermike/physical-web-scan on the laptop.
