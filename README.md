# beacon-ball
Throwing some info around the office, a project lounge.

# Installation
```
npm install
```
You can run this locally but the beacon needs a fixed url, [so it is hosted here](http://hxpaul.github.io/beacon-ball/). Push changes to the gh-pages branch to deploy.


# Requirements
Something to read from a beacon, I'm using https://github.com/dermike/physical-web-scan on the laptop.
